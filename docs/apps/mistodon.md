# Mistodon

**Decentralized Social Network**

Mistodon is a decentralized social network built on GunDB, focusing on user ownership and privacy. Unlike federated networks (like Mastodon) where admins control instances, Mistodon is fully peer-to-peer.

## Features

- **True Ownership**: Your data lives on your device and is synced via relays.
- **Uncensorable**: No central authority can ban users or remove content.
- **Privacy-First**: End-to-end encrypted direct messages and private posts.
- **Interoperable**: Part of the Shogun ecosystem, sharing identity with other apps.

## Architecture

Mistodon uses GunDB for data storage and propagation. It connects to Shogun Relays for content discovery but does not depend on any single relay.

- **Identity**: Uses SEA (Security, Encryption, Authorization) keypairs.
- **Storage**: IPFS integration for media attachments.
