# Shogun Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **Shogun Protocol**.

Shogun is a decentralized ecosystem designed to unify data storage, communication, and value transfer. It combines the power of **GunDB** for real-time graph data, **IPFS** for decentralized file storage, and **Blockchain** (Base/Optimism) for incentives and access control.
